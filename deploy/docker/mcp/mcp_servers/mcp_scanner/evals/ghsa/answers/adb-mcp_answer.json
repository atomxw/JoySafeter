            "details": "The adb-mcp MCP Server is vulnerable to command injection attacks. The `executeAdbCommand()` function executes commands using the `exec` function, which is unsafe when used with untrusted user input. The `inspect_ui` tool takes a `device` argument that can be manipulated to inject arbitrary shell commands. An attacker could exploit this by tricking a large language model (LLM) into calling the tool with a malicious device string, leading to remote command execution on the host running the MCP Server.",
