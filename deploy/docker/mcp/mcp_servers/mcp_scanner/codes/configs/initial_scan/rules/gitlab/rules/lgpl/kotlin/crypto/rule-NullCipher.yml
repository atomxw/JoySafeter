    message: |
      The NullCipher implements the Cipher interface by returning ciphertext identical to the
      supplied plaintext. In a few contexts, such as testing, a NullCipher may be appropriate. Avoid
      using the NullCipher. Its accidental use can introduce a significant confidentiality risk.
