## Recent Change Log

### Core Capabilities
- **Meta-Cognitive Superpowers** (`57fdac5`): Introduced structured reasoning capabilities including Brainstorming, Strategic Planning, and Execution. This elevates the agent from simple task execution to complex problem-solving by formalizing the "thinking process" into executable semantic skills.
- **Extensible Skill Protocol** (`cada4d3`): Established the `SKILL.md` standard with a "Progressive Disclosure" architecture. This mechanism optimizes context window usage by dynamically loading skill metadata, instructions, and resources only when needed, turning the agent into an infinitely validatable platform.

### System Architecture
- **Multi-Tenant Sandbox Engine** (`7aa24c8`): Implemented strict per-user isolation for code execution environments. This enterprise-grade security feature guarantees data sovereignty and prevents state leakage between concurrent user sessions.
- **Glass-Box Observability** (`f5a8a16`): Integrated deep visualization of agent execution traces with Langfuse. Users can now observe the real-time decision-making process and state transitions, providing full transparency into the agent's "thought process".

### Optimization & Infrastructure
- **Secure Runtime Transition** (`420da8f`): Deprecated legacy insecure execution paths, enforcing the new Sandbox architecture for all dynamic code operations.
- **Enterprise Identity Integration** (`9583309`): Standardized Single Sign-On (SSO) protocols, correcting naming conventions and adding support for `jd` providers to ensure seamless enterprise identity management.
- **Core Kernel Upgrade** (`4390ae5`): Upgraded `deepagents` kernel to v0.3.11, incorporating the latest stability improvements and performance optimizations.
