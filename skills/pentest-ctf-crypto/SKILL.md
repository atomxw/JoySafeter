# Pentest CTF Crypto

## Purpose
Analyze and break cryptographic implementations, including classical ciphers, RSA weak keys, and hash extensions.

## Core Workflow
1. **Cipher Identification**: Identify the type of encryption or encoding used (e.g., Base64, Caesar, RSA).
2. **Classical Cracking**: Brute-force or analyze frequency for classical ciphers using `ciphey` or online tools.
3. **RSA Attacks**: Check for common RSA weaknesses (small e, small factors) using `RsaCtfTool`.
4. **Hash Analysis**: Identify hash types and attempt cracking or length extension attacks using `hashcat` or `hashpump`.
5. **Math/Primes**: Solve mathematical problems related to cryptography using `sagemath`.
