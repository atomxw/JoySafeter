# Tools

# Race Condition Tools

## Common response fields

- success: boolean
- stdout, stderr: command output
- response_times: array of per-request timing in milliseconds
- race_detected: boolean indicator of successful race exploitation

## Timing-synchronized request tools

- turbo_intruder_race(target, request_template, concurrent_requests=20, engine="threaded", gate="single_packet", additional_args=""): Burp Turbo Intruder for single-packet attack. gate: "single_packet"|"tcp_sync"|"none". Sends all requests in one TCP packet for microsecond synchronization.
- race_the_web(config_file, target="", method="POST", data="", count=10, verbose=False): Standalone race condition testing tool. config_file defines target, method, headers, body, and concurrency.

## Async HTTP scripting

- aiohttp_race(url, method="POST", data="", headers="", cookies="", concurrent=20, timeout=10): Python aiohttp-based parallel requests. Returns array of response status codes and bodies for comparison.
- httpx_parallel(url, method="POST", data="", headers="", count=20, http2=False): Python httpx async client. http2=True for HTTP/2 multiplexed requests on single connection.
- requests_threaded(url, method="POST", data="", headers="", threads=20, barrier=True): Python requests with threading.Barrier for synchronized start. barrier=True ensures all threads fire simultaneously.

## Shell concurrency

- gnu_parallel_curl(url, method="POST", data="", jobs=20, header=""): GNU parallel with curl for quick race tests. Each job sends one request; all start near-simultaneously.
- xargs_curl(url, count=20, method="POST", data="", max_procs=20): xargs -P for parallel curl invocations. Simpler than GNU parallel for basic tests.

## State verification

- state_checker(url, method="GET", headers="", field="", expected=""): Poll endpoint to verify state changes (balance, count, inventory). Compare before/after race.
- db_query(query, db_type="postgres", connection_string=""): Direct database query to verify row-level state after race. Use for definitive impact confirmation.
