# CTF and Forensics Workflows (Pentest patterns)

## CTF category tool mapping (from CTFWorkflowManager)

- web: reconnaissance, vulnerability_scanning, content_discovery, parameter_testing
- crypto: hash_analysis, cipher_analysis, rsa_attacks, frequency_analysis, modern_crypto
- pwn: binary_analysis, exploit_development, heap_exploitation, format_string, rop_chains
- forensics: file_analysis, image_forensics, memory_forensics, network_forensics, disk_forensics
- rev: disassemblers, debuggers, decompilers, packers, analysis
- misc: encoding, compression, qr_codes, audio_analysis, esoteric
- osint: search_engines, social_media, image_analysis, domain_analysis, geolocation

Use MCP-exposed tools where available. For tools not exposed, run via execute_command if installed.

## Solving strategies (high level)

- Web: source analysis, traversal tests, injection checks, auth bypass, file upload testing.
- Crypto: frequency analysis, known-plaintext, weak keys, implementation flaws.
- Pwn: buffer overflow, format string, ROP chains, heap exploitation.
- Forensics: file carving, metadata analysis, memory analysis, network analysis.
- Rev: static and dynamic analysis, unpacking, key recovery.

## Forensics triage sequence

1. Identify file type and hash.
2. Run foremost_carving and strings_extract for quick wins.
3. Extract metadata with exiftool_extract.
4. For memory, run volatility_analyze or volatility3_analyze with targeted plugins.
5. Validate artifacts and document chain of custody.
