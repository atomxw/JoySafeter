# Pentest CTF Binary

## Purpose
Analyze binary files to understand their behavior, identify memory corruption vulnerabilities, and develop exploits (ROP, Heap, Format String).

## Core Workflow
1. **Static Analysis**: Inspect binary properties, protections (NX, PIE), and code structure using `checksec` and `ghidra`.
2. **Dynamic Analysis**: Run the binary under a debugger (`gdb`) to observe behavior and register states.
3. **Vulnerability Identification**: Locate crashes, buffer overflows, or format string bugs.
4. **Exploit Development**: Construct payloads (shellcode, ROP chains) using `pwntools`.
5. **Remote Exploitation**: Launch the exploit against the target server to retrieve the flag.
