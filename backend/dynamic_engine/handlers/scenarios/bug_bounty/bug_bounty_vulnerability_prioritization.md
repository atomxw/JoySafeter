# Bug Bounty Vulnerability Prioritization

## Overview

- Purpose: Systematically prioritize high-impact vulnerabilities and map them to specialized tools
- Category: vulnerability_assessment
- Severity: high
- Tags: bug-bounty, vulnerability-prioritization, impact-scoring, tool-mapping

## Context and Use-Cases

- Allocating testing effort based on vulnerability impact and bounty value
- Selecting appropriate tools for each vulnerability type
- Optimizing reconnaissance workflow to discover highest-priority vulnerabilities first
- Maximizing bounty earnings by focusing on critical vulnerabilities

## Procedure / Knowledge detail

### Vulnerability Priority Scoring System

The system ranks 8 high-impact vulnerability types with priority scores from 5-10:

| Vulnerability Type | Priority Score | Impact Level | Tools |
|---|---|---|---|
| RCE (Remote Code Execution) | 10 | Critical | nuclei, jaeles, sqlmap |
| SQLi (SQL Injection) | 9 | Critical | sqlmap, nuclei |
| SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) | 8 | High | nuclei, ffuf |
| IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) | 8 | High | arjun, paramspider, ffuf |
| XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) | 7 | High | dalfox, nuclei |
| LFI (Local File Inclusion) | 7 | High | ffuf, nuclei |
| XXE (XML External Entity) | 6 | Medium | nuclei |
| CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) | 5 | Medium | nuclei |

### Priority-Based Workflow Generation

1. **Extract priority vulnerabilities** from target configuration
2. **Sort by priority score** (highest first)
3. **Allocate testing time** based on priority: `time = priority × 30 seconds`
4. **Assign specialized tools** for each vulnerability type
5. **Generate test scenarios** with specific payloads

### Tool Mapping Strategy

Each vulnerability type is mapped to specialized tools:

- **RCE**: nuclei (template-based), jaeles (modular), sqlmap (database-specific)
- **SQLi**: sqlmap (comprehensive), nuclei (pattern matching)
- **SSRF**: nuclei (template-based), ffuf (fuzzing)
- **IDOR**: arjun (parameter discovery), paramspider (historical), ffuf (fuzzing)
- **XSS**: dalfox (specialized), nuclei (template-based)
- **LFI**: ffuf (fuzzing), nuclei (pattern matching)
- **XXE**: nuclei (template-based)
- **CSRF**: nuclei (template-based)

### Time Estimation Formula

```
Estimated Time = Priority Score × 30 seconds

Examples:
- RCE (priority 10): 300 seconds (5 minutes)
- SQLi (priority 9): 270 seconds (4.5 minutes)
- IDOR (priority 8): 240 seconds (4 minutes)
- CSRF (priority 5): 150 seconds (2.5 minutes)
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Web Application Prioritization

```
Target: example.com
Priority Vulnerabilities: [rce, sqli, xss, idor, ssrf]

Sorted by Priority:
1. RCE (priority 10) → 300s → nuclei, jaeles, sqlmap
2. SQLi (priority 9) → 270s → sqlmap, nuclei
3. SSRF (priority 8) → 240s → nuclei, ffuf
4. IDOR (priority 8) → 240s → arjun, paramspider, ffuf
5. XSS (priority 7) → 210s → dalfox, nuclei

Total Estimated Time: 1260 seconds (21 minutes)
Total Priority Score: 42
```

### Example 2: API-Focused Program

```
Target: api.company.io
Priority Vulnerabilities: [idor, sqli, authentication_bypass, logic_flaw]

Mapped to System:
1. IDOR (priority 8) → 240s → arjun, paramspider, ffuf
2. SQLi (priority 9) → 270s → sqlmap, nuclei
3. Authentication Bypass → custom testing
4. Logic Flaw → manual testing

Estimated Time: 510s + manual testing
```

- bug_bounty_reconnaissance_workflow - Multi-phase reconnaissance

## Best Practices

1. **Start with highest priority** - Focus on RCE and SQLi first
2. **Use specialized tools** - Each vulnerability type has optimal tools
3. **Allocate time proportionally** - Higher priority = more testing time
4. **Combine tools** - Use multiple tools for comprehensive coverage
5. **Track success rates** - Monitor which tools are most effective
6. **Adapt based on findings** - Adjust priorities if vulnerabilities are discovered
7. **Consider program type** - API programs may prioritize IDOR over XSS
