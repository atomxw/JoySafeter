description: Generate automated authentication bypass exploit scripts from CVE data using SQL injection and header manipulation techniques
severity: critical
prerequisites:
  - Python 3 with requests library
  - Target CVE data with authentication bypass vulnerability
  - Network access to target application
  - Authorization to test target system
indicators:
  - Login attempts with SQL injection payloads (admin' --, ' or 1=1--)
  - Requests with spoofed headers (X-Forwarded-For, X-Remote-User)
  - Multiple failed login attempts followed by successful access
detection:
  - log_source: Authentication logs
    query_or_rule: "username LIKE '%' or%' OR username LIKE 'admin%--'"
    notes: Monitor for SQL injection patterns in authentication attempts
  - log_source: Web server access logs
    query_or_rule: "X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1|X-Remote-User:|X-Forwarded-User:"
    notes: Detect suspicious header-based bypass attempts
mitigation:
  - action: Use parameterized queries for authentication
    details: Prevent SQL injection in login forms with prepared statements
  - action: Validate authentication headers
    details: Do not trust X-Forwarded-* headers without proper validation
  - action: Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA)
    details: Add second factor to prevent single-point bypass
  - action: Rate limiting and account lockout
    details: Limit login attempts and lock accounts after failures
