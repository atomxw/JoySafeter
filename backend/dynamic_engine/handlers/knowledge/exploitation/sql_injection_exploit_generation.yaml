description: Generate automated SQL injection exploit scripts from CVE data with time-based blind testing, database enumeration, and table dumping capabilities
severity: high
prerequisites:
  - Python 3 with requests library
  - Target CVE data with description and parameters
  - Network access to target application
  - Authorization to test target system
indicators:
  - Outbound HTTP requests with SQL injection payloads
  - Time delays in responses (3+ seconds for time-based blind)
  - UNION SELECT queries in request parameters
  - Database enumeration queries to information_schema
detection:
  - log_source: Web Application Firewall (WAF) logs
    query_or_rule: "SELECT|UNION|SLEEP|WAITFOR|information_schema|--"
    notes: Monitor for SQL keywords in URL parameters and POST data
  - log_source: Database query logs
    query_or_rule: "SLEEP(3)|WAITFOR DELAY|UNION SELECT.*information_schema"
    notes: Detect time-based blind and UNION-based injection attempts
mitigation:
  - action: Use parameterized queries and prepared statements
    details: Prevent SQL injection by separating SQL code from user input
  - action: Implement input validation and sanitization
    details: Validate and escape all user inputs before database queries
  - action: Apply principle of least privilege to database accounts
    details: Limit database user permissions to minimum required operations
  - action: Deploy Web Application Firewall (WAF)
    details: Filter malicious SQL injection patterns at application edge
limitations:
  - Requires manual customization for application-specific response parsing
  - Time-based blind detection may produce false positives on slow networks
  - UNION SELECT payloads require knowledge of column count
  - May trigger IDS/IPS alerts and account lockouts
