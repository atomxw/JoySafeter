description: Generate automated Remote Code Execution (RCE) exploit scripts from CVE data with command injection, template injection, and interactive shell capabilities
severity: critical
prerequisites:
  - Python 3 with requests library
  - Target CVE data with RCE vulnerability information
  - Network access to target application
  - Authorization to test target system
indicators:
  - HTTP requests with command injection payloads (; | && ||)
  - Template injection patterns (${{}} {{}})
  - Command execution indicators (id, whoami, pwd) in responses
  - Unusual process execution on target system
detection:
  - log_source: Web Application Firewall (WAF) logs
    query_or_rule: "(;|\\||&&|\\$\\{|`|\\$\\()"
    notes: Monitor for command injection metacharacters in parameters
  - log_source: System process logs
    query_or_rule: "parent_process=httpd|nginx|apache AND (process=sh|bash|cmd|powershell)"
    notes: Detect web server spawning shell processes
mitigation:
  - action: Avoid system command execution from user input
    details: Use language-native functions instead of shell commands
  - action: Input validation with strict whitelisting
    details: Only allow alphanumeric characters, reject all shell metacharacters
  - action: Use parameterized APIs and safe functions
    details: Use subprocess with shell=False, avoid eval() and exec()
  - action: Apply principle of least privilege
    details: Run web applications with minimal system permissions
limitations:
  - Command output detection relies on simple string matching
  - May not work with blind RCE scenarios without output
  - Interactive shell requires stable network connection
  - Payloads may be blocked by WAF or command filters
