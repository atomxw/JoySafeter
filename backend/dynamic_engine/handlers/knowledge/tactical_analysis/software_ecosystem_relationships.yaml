description: Software dependency and co-deployment relationship mapping for attack surface analysis, lateral movement path discovery, and vulnerability propagation assessment
severity: info
prerequisites:
  - Asset inventory with software versions
  - Network topology understanding
  - Knowledge of common software stacks
indicators:
  - Common software deployment patterns
  - Technology stack fingerprints
  - Service co-location signatures
detection:
  - log_source: Asset Management System
    query_or_rule: "SELECT software, COUNT(*) as instances FROM assets GROUP BY software HAVING instances > threshold"
    notes: Identify widespread software that could enable lateral movement
  - log_source: Network Traffic Analysis
    query_or_rule: "protocol IN (smb, rdp, ssh, wmi) AND src_software_stack = dst_software_stack"
    notes: Detect lateral movement within same ecosystem
mitigation:
  - action: Network segmentation by ecosystem
    details: Isolate Windows, Linux, and database tiers with firewall rules
  - action: Minimize cross-ecosystem trust relationships
    details: Avoid allowing Linux systems to authenticate to Windows AD without MFA
  - action: Patch ecosystem-wide vulnerabilities simultaneously
    details: When patching Apache, also patch PHP/MySQL in same maintenance window
limitations:
  - Static mapping may not reflect actual deployment configurations
  - Cloud and containerized environments have dynamic relationships
  - Custom integrations may create undocumented dependencies
  - Assumes typical deployment patterns which may vary by organization
