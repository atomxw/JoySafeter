# Multi-Stage Attack Chain Modeling

## Overview
- **Purpose**: Discover and evaluate viable multi-stage attack chains by linking vulnerabilities across MITRE ATT&CK tactical stages with probabilistic success scoring
- **Category**: tactical_analysis
- **Severity**: medium
- **Tags**: attack-chain, kill-chain, threat-modeling, risk-assessment, attack-path, red-team-planning, TA0001, TA0004, TA0003

## Context and Use-Cases
- **Red Team Planning**: Identify complete attack paths from initial access to objectives (data exfiltration, persistence)
- **Threat Modeling**: Assess which attack chains are most viable against specific targets
- **Risk Prioritization**: Focus patching on vulnerabilities that enable high-probability attack chains
- **Purple Team Exercises**: Test detection coverage across multi-stage attack scenarios
- **Security Architecture**: Design defenses that break attack chains at critical junctures
- **Incident Response**: Predict attacker next moves based on current stage in kill chain

## Key Parameters and Inputs
- **target_software** (string, required): Primary target software/platform. Example: `"Windows Server 2019"`
- **max_depth** (integer, optional): Maximum attack chain length. Default: `3`. Example: `5`
- **vulnerability_database** (list, required): Available vulnerabilities with metadata. Example:
  ```python
  [
    {"cve_id": "CVE-2024-1234", "cvss_score": 9.8, "exploitability": "HIGH", "stage": "initial_access"},
    {"cve_id": "CVE-2024-5678", "cvss_score": 7.8, "exploitability": "MEDIUM", "stage": "privilege_escalation"}
  ]
  ```
- **success_probabilities** (dict, optional): Stage-specific success probability estimates. Example:
  ```python
  {
    "initial_access": 0.75,
    "privilege_escalation": 0.60,
    "persistence": 0.80
  }
  ```

## Procedure
1. **Classify Vulnerabilities**: Use attack pattern taxonomy to categorize vulnerabilities by tactical stage
2. **Identify Initial Access**: Find vulnerabilities enabling initial compromise (remote execution, authentication bypass)
3. **Build Chain Stages**: For each initial access vulnerability, attempt to extend chain with subsequent stages:
   - Stage 1: Initial Access (TA0001)
   - Stage 2: Privilege Escalation (TA0004)
   - Stage 3: Persistence (TA0003)
   - Stage 4: Lateral Movement (TA0008) [optional]
   - Stage 5: Data Exfiltration (TA0010) [optional]
4. **Calculate Chain Probability**: Multiply individual stage success probabilities
5. **Rank Chains**: Sort by overall probability and complexity
6. **Generate Recommendations**: Provide actionable guidance for red/blue teams

### Probability Calculation Examples

**Independent Stage Probabilities**
```python
# Chain: Initial Access (85%) → Privilege Escalation (60%) → Persistence (80%)
overall_probability = 0.85 * 0.60 * 0.80 = 0.408 (40.8%)

# Interpretation: 40.8% chance of successfully completing entire chain
```

**Impact of Patching**
```python
# Before patching
chain_probability = 0.85 * 0.60 * 0.80 = 0.408

# After patching privilege escalation vulnerability
chain_probability = 0.85 * 0.0 * 0.80 = 0.0  # Chain broken

# After hardening (reducing stage probability)
chain_probability = 0.85 * 0.30 * 0.80 = 0.204  # 50% risk reduction
```

## Indicators / Detection

### Log Sources
- SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)
- EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)
- Network Traffic Analysis
- Application Logs

### Detection Patterns

**Splunk - Sequential Attack Stage Detection**
```spl
index=security_events 
| eval stage=case(
    match(event_type, "exploit|rce|injection"), "initial_access",
    match(event_type, "privilege_escalation|sudo|kernel"), "privilege_escalation",
    match(event_type, "persistence|service_creation|scheduled_task"), "persistence",
    match(event_type, "lateral_movement|smb|rdp"), "lateral_movement",
    1=1, "other"
)
| transaction src_ip maxspan=4h
| where mvcount(stage) >= 3
| stats values(stage) as attack_chain, values(event_type) as events by src_ip
| where match(attack_chain, "initial_access.*privilege_escalation.*persistence")
```

**Sigma Rule - Multi-Stage Attack Chain**
```yaml
title: Multi-Stage Attack Chain Detected
logsource:
  category: security_events
detection:
  initial_access:
    event_type:
      - exploit
      - rce
      - authentication_bypass
  privilege_escalation:
    event_type:
      - privilege_escalation
      - kernel_exploit
      - sudo_abuse
  persistence:
    event_type:
      - service_creation
      - scheduled_task
      - registry_modification
  timeframe: 4h
  condition: initial_access followed by privilege_escalation followed by persistence
level: high
```

**Python - Attack Chain Correlation**

## Mitigation Strategies

### Break Chains at Critical Stages

**Priority 1: Initial Access Prevention**
- Patch internet-facing vulnerabilities immediately
- Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Network segmentation (DMZ isolation)
- Multi-factor authentication for remote access

**Priority 2: Privilege Escalation Prevention**
- Kernel hardening (SELinux, AppArmor)
- Disable unnecessary SUID binaries
- Implement LAPS for local admin passwords
- Regular privilege audits

**Priority 3: Persistence Detection**
- File integrity monitoring
- Service creation monitoring
- Registry monitoring (Windows)
- Cron/systemd monitoring (Linux)

### Defense-in-Depth by Stage

```yaml
stage: initial_access
controls:
  preventive:
    - WAF with OWASP ModSecurity CRS
    - Network firewall rules (whitelist only)
    - Input validation and sanitization
  detective:
    - IDS/IPS signatures for known exploits
    - Anomaly detection on web traffic
    - Failed authentication monitoring
  responsive:
    - Automatic IP blocking after threshold
    - Incident response playbook activation
    - Forensic data collection

stage: privilege_escalation
controls:
  preventive:
    - Principle of least privilege
    - Kernel exploit mitigations (KASLR, SMEP)
    - Disable dangerous sudo configurations
  detective:
    - EDR monitoring for privilege changes
    - Audit logs for sudo/su usage
    - Kernel exploit detection (LKRG)
  responsive:
    - Automatic privilege revocation
    - Account lockout
    - Isolate affected systems

stage: persistence
controls:
  preventive:
    - Immutable system files
    - Disable unnecessary startup locations
    - Code signing enforcement
  detective:
    - File integrity monitoring (AIDE, Tripwire)
    - Service creation alerts
    - Scheduled task monitoring
  responsive:
    - Remove malicious persistence
    - Rebuild from known-good image
    - Hunt for additional persistence mechanisms
```

### Reduce Chain Probability Through Patching

```python
# Patching strategy based on chain impact
def calculate_patching_impact(chains, vulnerability_to_patch):
    """Calculate risk reduction from patching a vulnerability"""
    
    total_risk_before = sum(chain["overall_probability"] for chain in chains)
    
    # Remove chains that use this vulnerability
    remaining_chains = [
        chain for chain in chains
        if not any(
            stage["vulnerability"]["cve_id"] == vulnerability_to_patch
            for stage in chain["stages"]
        )
    ]
    
    total_risk_after = sum(chain["overall_probability"] for chain in remaining_chains)
    
    risk_reduction = total_risk_before - total_risk_after
    risk_reduction_percent = (risk_reduction / total_risk_before) * 100
    
    return {
        "vulnerability": vulnerability_to_patch,
        "chains_broken": len(chains) - len(remaining_chains),
        "risk_reduction": risk_reduction,
        "risk_reduction_percent": f"{risk_reduction_percent:.1f}%",
        "remaining_risk": total_risk_after
    }
```

## Limitations and Caveats

- **Probability Estimates**: Success probabilities are heuristic, not empirically validated
- **Independence Assumption**: Assumes stage probabilities are independent (may not be true)
- **Static Analysis**: Does not account for dynamic defender actions or detection
- **Known Vulnerabilities Only**: Limited to vulnerabilities in database (misses zero-days)
- **Simplified Model**: Real attacks may involve parallel paths, retries, and adaptation
- **No Detection Probability**: Does not model likelihood of detection at each stage
- **Resource Constraints**: Does not account for attacker skill, time, or tool availability
- **Environmental Factors**: Network topology, security controls, and monitoring affect real probability
- **Complexity Calculation**: Simplified complexity metric may not reflect operational difficulty

# From vul_correlators.py lines 48-64
{
    "stage": 1,
    "objective": "Initial Access",
    "vulnerability": initial_vuln,
    "success_probability": 0.75
}

# Multiplicative probability for chain
chain["overall_probability"] *= 0.60  # Stage 2 probability
chain["overall_probability"] *= 0.80  # Stage 3 probability

# Final: 0.75 * 0.60 * 0.80 = 0.36 (36% overall success)
```

        "Recommendations:",
        "- Test chains in order of probability",
        "- Prepare fallback methods for each stage",
        "- Consider detection evasion at each stage"
