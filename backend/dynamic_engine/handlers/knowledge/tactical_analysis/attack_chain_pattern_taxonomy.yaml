description: Keyword-based taxonomy for classifying CVE descriptions and vulnerability reports into MITRE ATT&CK tactical stages for attack chain analysis
severity: info
prerequisites:
  - CVE descriptions or vulnerability reports
  - Understanding of MITRE ATT&CK framework
  - Text analysis or pattern matching capability
indicators:
  - Keywords appearing in CVE descriptions
  - Attack pattern signatures in threat intelligence feeds
  - Vulnerability classification metadata
detection:
  - log_source: Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP)
    query_or_rule: "tag:privilege_escalation OR tag:lateral_movement OR tag:persistence"
    notes: Track vulnerabilities by tactical classification for attack path analysis
  - log_source: CVE Database
    query_or_rule: "description CONTAINS ('local privilege', 'kernel exploit', 'suid binary', 'sudo bypass')"
    notes: Automated CVE categorization based on keyword patterns
mitigation:
  - action: Prioritize patching by attack chain stage
    details: Focus on Initial Access and Privilege Escalation vulnerabilities first to break attack chains early
  - action: Implement defense-in-depth per tactical stage
    details: Deploy controls at each stage (EDR for execution, MFA for lateral movement, file integrity for persistence)
limitations:
  - Keyword matching may produce false positives for ambiguous terms
  - Does not capture zero-day or novel attack techniques not in taxonomy
  - Requires regular updates to reflect evolving threat landscape
  - Single vulnerability may map to multiple tactical stages
