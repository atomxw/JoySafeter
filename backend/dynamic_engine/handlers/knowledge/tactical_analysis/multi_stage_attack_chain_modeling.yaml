description: Probabilistic modeling framework for discovering and evaluating multi-stage attack chains by chaining vulnerabilities across MITRE ATT&CK tactical stages with success probability scoring
severity: medium
prerequisites:
  - Vulnerability database with CVE details
  - Attack pattern taxonomy for classification
  - Software ecosystem relationship mapping
  - Understanding of MITRE ATT&CK framework
indicators:
  - Sequential vulnerability exploitation patterns
  - Multi-stage attack signatures in logs
  - Chained exploit attempts across tactical stages
detection:
  - log_source: SIEM / Security Analytics Platform
    query_or_rule: "sequence by src_ip [initial_access] [privilege_escalation within 1h] [persistence within 2h]"
    notes: Detect attack chain progression using temporal correlation
  - log_source: EDR / Endpoint Detection
    query_or_rule: "process_chain: exploit.exe -> escalate.exe -> persist.exe"
    notes: Monitor for sequential malicious process execution
mitigation:
  - action: Break attack chains at critical stages
    details: Focus defensive controls on Initial Access and Privilege Escalation to prevent chain completion
  - action: Implement defense-in-depth across all stages
    details: Deploy multiple controls per stage so single control failure doesn't enable full chain
  - action: Monitor for sequential attack patterns
    details: Use SIEM correlation rules to detect multi-stage attack progression
  - action: Reduce attack chain probability through patching
    details: Patching any stage vulnerability reduces overall chain success probability multiplicatively
limitations:
  - Probability scores are heuristic estimates, not empirically validated
  - Assumes independent stage success probabilities (may not reflect reality)
  - Does not account for defender actions or detection probability
  - Limited to known vulnerabilities in database
  - Real attack chains may be more complex than modeled sequences
  - Requires regular updates as new vulnerabilities are disclosed
