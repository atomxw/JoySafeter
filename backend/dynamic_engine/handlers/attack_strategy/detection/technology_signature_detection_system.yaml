description: Comprehensive system for detecting web technologies using multiple signature-based methods (HTTP headers, HTML content, port patterns). Supports 14+ technologies across web servers, frameworks, CMS platforms, and frontend libraries.
prerequisites: [understanding of HTTP headers, HTML content analysis, port conventions, web technology stacks]

limitations:
  - Signature-based detection can be bypassed by removing/modifying identifying headers
  - Does not perform deep content analysis or behavioral detection
  - Port-based detection assumes standard configurations
  - Requires HTTP connectivity for header and content analysis
