# Bug Bounty High-Impact Exploitation

## Overview

- **Purpose**: High-impact vulnerability exploitation for bug bounties
- **Category**: attack-pattern
- **Severity**: high
- **Target Types**: Web Applications, API Endpoints
- **Execution Time**: 60 minutes
- **Aggressiveness**: High

## Context and Use-Cases

- **Critical vulnerability exploitation**: Exploit critical vulnerabilities
- **Advanced SQL injection**: Complex SQL injection exploitation
- **Advanced XSS exploitation**: Sophisticated XSS attacks
- **Signature-based exploitation**: Exploit known signatures
- **High-impact proof-of-concept**: Create compelling PoC
