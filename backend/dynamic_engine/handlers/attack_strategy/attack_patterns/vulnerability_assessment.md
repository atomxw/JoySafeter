# Vulnerability Assessment

## Overview

- **Purpose**: Focused vulnerability scanning and exploitation
- **Category**: attack-pattern
- **Severity**: high
- **Target Types**: Web Applications, API Endpoints
- **Execution Time**: 30 minutes
- **Aggressiveness**: High

## Context and Use-Cases

- **Vulnerability identification**: Discover known vulnerabilities
- **Exploitation testing**: Test vulnerability exploitability
- **XSS detection**: Identify cross-site scripting vulnerabilities
- **SQL injection testing**: Test for SQL injection vulnerabilities
- **Web server scanning**: Comprehensive web server analysis

## Procedure / Knowledge Detail

### Tool Sequence (5 tools)

1. **nuclei** - Template-based vulnerability scanning
2. **jaeles** - Signature-based scanning
3. **dalfox** - XSS detection and exploitation
4. **nikto** - Web server scanning
5. **sqlmap** - SQL injection testing

## Expected Outputs

- Vulnerability findings with severity levels
- Exploitation proof-of-concept
- XSS payloads and vectors
- SQL injection confirmation
- Web server vulnerabilities

## Related Knowledge Items

- web_reconnaissance
- api_testing
- bug_bounty_vulnerability_hunting
- tool_effectiveness_scoring_system

## Best Practices

1. Run nuclei first for template-based scanning
2. Use dalfox for XSS-specific testing
3. Test SQL injection with sqlmap
4. Verify findings with multiple tools
5. Document all vulnerabilities found
6. Prioritize by severity level
7. Test for false positives
8. Confirm exploitability before reporting

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Tools | 5 |
| Estimated Time | 30 minutes |
| Aggressiveness | High |
| Detection Risk | High |
| Coverage | High |
| Accuracy | 85-90% |

## Notes

- This pattern focuses on vulnerability discovery
- Can be combined with web reconnaissance
- Results should be verified before exploitation
- Consider target's security posture
