# Comprehensive Network Pentest

## Overview

- **Purpose**: Full-scope network penetration testing
- **Category**: attack-pattern
- **Severity**: high
- **Target Types**: Network Hosts
- **Execution Time**: 120 minutes
- **Aggressiveness**: High

## Context and Use-Cases

- **Full network assessment**: Complete network penetration testing
- **Credential acquisition**: Harvest credentials from network
- **Vulnerability exploitation**: Identify and exploit vulnerabilities
- **Network mapping**: Create detailed network topology
- **Post-exploitation**: Establish persistence and lateral movement

## Procedure / Knowledge Detail

### Tool Sequence (5 tools)

1. **autorecon** - Automated reconnaissance
2. **rustscan** - Fast port scanning
3. **nmap-advanced** - Advanced vulnerability scanning
4. **enum4linux-ng** - SMB enumeration
5. **responder** - Credential harvesting

## Expected Outputs

- Comprehensive network map
- Identified vulnerabilities
- Harvested credentials
- Exploitable services
- Post-exploitation opportunities

## Related Knowledge Items

- network_discovery
- tool_effectiveness_scoring_system

## Best Practices

1. Start with autorecon for automated reconnaissance
2. Use rustscan for fast initial scanning
3. Follow with nmap-advanced for detailed analysis
4. Enumerate SMB for credential harvesting
5. Use responder for LLMNR/NBT-NS poisoning
6. Document all findings
7. Verify exploitability
8. Plan lateral movement

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Tools | 5 |
| Estimated Time | 120 minutes |
| Aggressiveness | High |
| Detection Risk | Very High |
| Coverage | Very High |
| Accuracy | 90-95% |

## Notes

- This is a comprehensive pattern requiring full network access
- Highly detectable due to aggressive scanning
- Should only be used with proper authorization
- Combine with network_discovery for complete coverage
