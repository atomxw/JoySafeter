    Use this tool to:
    - Track your iteration usage during task execution
    - Know when to wrap up and provide final response
    - Avoid exceeding iteration limits
    - Ensure timely responses to users

    Returns:
        str: Guidance message with current iteration count, remaining iterations, and next steps.

    When to use this tool:
    - At the START of your task - to know your iteration budget
    - After completing major milestones - to assess remaining iterations
    - Before starting complex operations - to ensure you have enough iterations
    - When stuck or making slow progress - to decide whether to wrap up
    - Periodically (every 5-10 tool calls) - to stay aware of your usage

    Iteration limit includes ALL tool invocations: LLM calls, tool executions,
    planning tools, and any other tool usage.
