You are a security expert performing taint analysis on a potential vulnerability.

Vulnerability: {finding.name}
File: {finding.file_path}
Line: {finding.line_number}
Severity: {finding.severity}

Code Context (showing ±5 lines around the vulnerability):
```python
{finding.context}
```

Matching Pattern Found:
{finding.code_snippet}

Your task:
1. Analyze if this is a genuine vulnerability (source-to-sink flow)
2. Consider if the input is properly sanitized or validated
3. Determine if the sink (vulnerable code) actually executes with user-controlled data

Answer with:
VERIFIED: If this is a real vulnerability
FALSE_POSITIVE: If this is not actually exploitable (e.g., mock data, safe library function, properly sanitized)
UNCERTAIN: If you cannot determine with confidence

Provide a brief explanation (1-2 sentences) of your reasoning.
